    Check if given value is correct for control number in ID code only with the first algorithm.

    The first algorithm can be calculated with ID code's first 10 numbers.
    Each number must be multiplied with its corresponding digit
    (in this task, corresponding digits are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1), after which all the values are summarized
    and divided by 11. The remainder of calculation should be the control number.

    If the remainder is less than 10 and equal to the last number of ID code,
    then that's the correct control number and the function should return the ID code.
    Otherwise, the control number is either incorrect or the second algorithm should be used.
    In this case, return "Needs the second algorithm!".

    If the string contains more or less than 11 numbers, return "Incorrect ID code!".
    In other case use the previous algorithm to get the code number out of the string
    and find out, whether its control number is correct.
